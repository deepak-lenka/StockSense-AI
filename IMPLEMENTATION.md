# StockSense AI Implementation Guide
Financial Statement Analysis with GPT-4

## Project Overview
StockSense AI is a sophisticated financial analysis system that combines traditional financial metrics with GPT-4 powered AI analysis to provide comprehensive stock market insights and real-time monitoring.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. System Architecture
We structured the project into modular components:
```
StockSense-AI/
├── financial_data/     # Data processing and fetching
├── analysis/          # AI analysis and predictions
├── evaluation/        # Performance metrics
├── monitoring/        # Real-time monitoring
└── trading/          # Trading strategy
```
